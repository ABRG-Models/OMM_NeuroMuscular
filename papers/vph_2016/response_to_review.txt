I'd like to thank the reviewer for their comments, which were
constructive and useful. I'll reply to the comments and indicate where
I have changed the manuscript below.

(Introduction)

The description of BRAHMS and SpineML has been reduced. I've added the
equations governing the rate coded neural elements.

I have added additional detail to the description of the SC map -> SBG
conversion.

(Results)

This has been moved.

I have added a description of the data input for the training
process. I've not mentioned validation because the centroiding step,
ensures that only a single neural element drives the SC to SBG weight
maps and the range of inputs given ensures that every active element
in each weight map is trained.

> The reference section lacks of the titles of the journal papers and
> has to be revised.

I believe I have followed the short format for the bibliography, given
in the VPH2016 extended abstract template, which does not include
journal paper titles and so I have not made any changes here.
