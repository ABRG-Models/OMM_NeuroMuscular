INTRO

1) The paragraph starting at line 45 makes several references to virtual biomechanical systems (e.g. virtual arm, virtual robot). I will also ensure that I explicitly state that the biomechanical eye in this study is a purely computational, virtual model, as I take the point that from the abstract, it is not clear that the eye is virtual rather than physical. The paragraph at line 57 changed to: In an attempt to build a model combining brain, realistic biomechanics \e{and} sensory feedback, we sought to extend our previous work modelling the oculomotor system by adding a virtual, biomechanical eye model able to make physically realistic movements. The rotational state of the eye would then determine how visual features in the virtual world were projected back into the brain model.

2) I've re-written the sentence to: Building a behaving oculomotor system will therefore assist future computational neurobehavioural modelling efforts that involve reaching.

3) Good point, I've removed the word channels from that sentence and clarified its meaning where it first appears at the start of the section "Brainstem model".

4) Changed as suggested.

5) This was engineer speak - I've changed the sentence to explicitly describe the mathematical eye in the referenced papers (a second order diff. equatio

MAT & METH

1) The rate coded model was chosen from the literature as the best saccadic burst generator available. I've modified the text to say this.

2) The first reference there seems ok - it's an RRID referencing the SpineML markup language SCR_015641.

3) I'll describe this.

4) Changed; size="integral" or "area under the curve"

5) YET TO ADDRESS.

RESULTS

1) Line 501 updated to 6 (a) & (b). I've added a much fuller
description of the results for the weight maps. Left and Right checked
for Fig 7. They were correct.

2) Yes, though not exactly of the excitatory nature required of the
connection we hypothesise here. The methods section referred to some
evidence; I have added two important references, extended the text in
the methods section and referred to this at the equivalent of line 531
in the reviewed draft.

3) Sentence modified as suggested.

4) End points were not shown in Fig 10(b) and (c) in order to zoom
inon the most dynamic part of the movement (between 0.55 and 0.6 s).

5) Surprising with hindsight perhaps - I removed that word. Later on
in that paragraph, after describing that the TNs were left 'active'
rather than being reset, I remarked: "Interestingly, this ensured
that, at least for a few, consecutive out-and-return saccades, the
saccade accuracy was relatively good, with trajectories resembling
experimental data". That is, the TN populations were firing away on
both out and return channels and yet the eye was returning nearly to
the null position. If this "accidental return accuracy" hadn't
occurred, we probably would have spotted the lack of TN reset
sooner. I added text to this effect.
