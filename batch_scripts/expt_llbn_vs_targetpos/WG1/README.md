For models used for these results see commits 14c386f to a028d80
The WideningGaussian.py script used for the connectivity is reproduced
in this directory for convenience.

WF was set to values between 4 and 30. WF0 means "the Gaussian Kernels
used in Model1".

sigma was 2, E2 was 2.5

widening_gaussian.m here shows the connectivity surface.
