This expt directory contains results from investigations of the
activity in LLBN populations. It's an experiment which was conducted
for model development, and won't produce results used in the paper.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
I first tested a WideningGaussian script before 4th July 2017 which was
not very well normalised. This is WG1.

On 4th July I'm now testing a script which has
better normalisation to see if this can help get the SC hill to be even
sized as a function of r. This is WG2.

On 5th July, I realised that the LLBN doesn't give me a reliable sum
of SC_Deep activity, so I need to run an expt_scdsum_vs_targetpos.
