To run this experiment, execute sacc_lat_vs_gap.sh several times,
modifying the value of LUMVAL in the script each time. This will
produce r_*.dat files in results/.

In octave, run plot_sacc_vs_g.m to plot the results and also output a
set of csv files (also in results/) which can be read into the veusz
graph.
