In the "combined_RotZ_Training" directory, make sure that all the data 
from the individual computing sessions has been concatenated into one 
file called allweights_mod.log.

Now open octave and

addpath ('path/to/Oculomotor/batch_scripts/analysis')
addpath ('path/to/Oculomotor/batch_scripts/analysis/include')

Now you can

load_justdata % This just loads the data

load_weights % This loads and graphs

fit_curve_up % Tries to fit a dual exponential surface

fit_curve_down % etc.
